# **HSE DASHBOARD - HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT ANALYTICS**

This project focuses on the development of an interactive dashboard to track key health, safety, and environmental (HSE) metrics for an organization. Built using **Power BI**, this dashboard allows users to monitor and analyze crucial data related to workplace accidents, health visits, environmental costs, supplier performance, and more. The dashboard offers a multilingual feature (French and German) for ease of use across different regions.

## **KEY FEATURES:**

### **SECURITY MONITORING:**
- Track total accidents, days lost due to accidents, and accident rates by body area.
- Visualize PPE distribution and accident trends over time.
- Analyze accident frequency, severity, and their impacts on different job positions.
#### **VIEW DASHBOARD SECURITY:**

- Analyze supplier performance by various departments and locations.

### **COST ANALYTICS:**
- Aggregate and visualize HSE-related costs by department and supplier.
- Analyze cost distribution by category (Health, Safety, Environment).
- Track top items by purchase cost and monitor purchase trends over time.

## **FUNCTIONALITIES:**
- **Multi-Language Support:** Switch between French and German for improved accessibility.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** View detailed KPIs, charts, and trends for better decision-making.
- **Comprehensive HSE Overview:** A unified view of all HSE-related activities in one interactive dashboard.

This project serves as a powerful tool for monitoring workplace safety, environmental performance, and health management, providing data-driven insights to improve operational efficiency.
