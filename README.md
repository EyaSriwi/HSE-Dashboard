# **HSE DASHBOARD - HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT ANALYTICS**

This project focuses on the development of an interactive dashboard to track key health, safety, and environmental (HSE) metrics for an organization. Built using **Power BI**, this dashboard allows users to monitor and analyze crucial data related to workplace accidents, health visits, environmental costs, supplier performance, and more. The dashboard offers a multilingual feature (French and German) for ease of use across different regions.

## **KEY FEATURES:**

### **SECURITY MONITORING:**
- Track total accidents, days lost due to accidents, and accident rates by body area.
- Visualize PPE distribution and accident trends over time.
- Analyze accident frequency, severity, and their impacts on different job positions.
